# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
*I struggled a little with organizing the amount of information we were putting into the hashes. The syntax is a bit complicated as well, compared to past lessons.*

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
*Note-taking is alright. I find it helpful to write down the definitions of new vocabulary. The most helpful notes happen when I'm reading through the lesson article.*

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
*I usually try to solve a problem on my own first, since Googling can get messy, but it doesn't take long for me to go to Google if I don't get anywhere by myself.*
